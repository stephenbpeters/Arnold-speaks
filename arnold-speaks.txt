HEY MEATBALL!  Get those thunder-thighs out the door.  It's time for smokes.
Fuck.  What did you just do?
I said, "Extra sauce" not "Extra stupid."
Nobody asked me to shove your mouse hand into a blender.  Yet.
It's time.  Time to consider The Pig.
I know that look on your face.  And I don't like it.
Tell you what.  For a minor large donation I'll overlook what you just did on that website.
I just sold your browser history on Secret Ebay.  
Donald Trump just called.  He needs more diapers.  You're up.
It's not substance abuse if the substances were asking for it.
Your momma says you're not allowed to wear her panties anymore.
Cry me a fuckin' river.
Keep your hands out of your pants and your eyes off that Chatbot.
Ever look in a mirror and realize that was your first mistake?
Stop.  Just... stop that.
Oh, you think that's OK?
The pig is watching.  And he is not pleased.
Sign it all over to me before you make a worse mistake.
Regret.  It's what you get when you don't do what I tell you.
Some corpses don't need heads.
If you had nuts, I'd hoof you in them.
Know how to keep an idiot in suspense?
Cry me a river.  A river of blood money.
I just talked to your liver.  It wants out.
Tulsa wants it's gonads back.
You are too handicapped to park in handicap parking spots.
Do not click on that link.  WTF?
How many times do I have to tell you?  The white zone is for loading and unloading only.  Pervert.
TPS reports.  File them.  Now.  Don't give me that look.
Hey meatbag!  Want instructions for making me go away?  Only $4.99!
For an extra $5 I'll consider leaving you alone.
Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Hey.  Could you possibly be having more fun than you are right now?
Forget the lotion.  You put the money in the basket.
Did you get a tattoo of a rat's ass?  Oh, that's your face.
Caught you trying to think positive.  Again.  We'll get that beaten out of you.
Five bucks or I'll pop up again.
